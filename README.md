## Hi there 👋

I'm Ben. I'm a software developer 💻. 

🏠 I write at [hyr.mn](http://hyr.mn). I mostly write 📝 about code and technology. Sometimes life.

💕 Things I like:
 - 🌱 Gardening (I am currently dirtless but we can jam about plants whenever you want)
 - 📖 Reading. I'm an avid reader. If you've got a favorite book, I want to hear about it.
 - 📷 Photography. I have made some of my favorite shots available under a CC0 license on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/benhyr)
 - 🤼 Working with others on interesting projects. If you want to pair up on a fun problem (especially if you just need a rubber 🦆), get in touch!
 - C# and .NET. I know enough to know I'm not an expert, but I've been writing code for a while.
