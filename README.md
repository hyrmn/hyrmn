## Hi there 👋

📝 I write at [hyr.mn](http://hyr.mn). I mostly write about code and technology. Sometimes life. 

I mostly like playing around with little apps or samples and I have quite a few [gists](https://gist.github.com/hyrmn). But, those aren't exactly approachable. Most of them were written to share either on Twitter or in various chat channels. I think I'll curate some of the most interesting ones over to my blog.

I have a lot of experience with C# and .NET. I think I have enough experience to say I'm definitely not an expert.

I also like learning other languages as I feel it gives me fresh ways to look at possible solutions in my domain. I haven't taken any language far enough to build out any of my [awesome ideas](https://github.com/hyrmn/ThousandDollarIdeas). But, I should. 

Lately, I've been diving into Go a bit more seriously. I know the language, and it's author, force rather polarizing opinions. For me, though, it's been wonderful as a low-ceremony, straight-forward language. In a way, it's brought back a lot of the joy I felt when I was first learning how to  program.

If you want help with anything related to gardening (one of my passions although I'm currently dirt-less), web development with .NET, or just someone to pair up with on fun problems, please reach out.

📫 You can get me at [hyrman@fastmail.net](mailto:hyrman@fastmail.net), [@hyrman](https://twitter.com/hyrmn) on twitter.com, or via issues on this repo (maybe, I guess we'll see how that goes)
